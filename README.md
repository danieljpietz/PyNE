# PyNE

PyNE is a package for simulating systems of rigid bodies with optimization based controllers.

It is still in alpha, so documentation is limited. The package can be pip installed if you clone the directory, but you will need to manually build OSQP in the lib directory of the package. Future releases will remove this burden
